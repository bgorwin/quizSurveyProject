# Quiz Survey
## Description: 
This is a project that I wanted to build to practice learning JavaScript and getting used to thinking in a software logic way. I'm going to documenting through this process as well so that I can get used to working with a team and having to communicate the details of a project so that someone looking through the project for the first time will be able to get a good grasp of what is happening. 

The project can be viewed via URL: https://bgorwin.github.io/quizSurveyProject/

## Project Details
- There will be a series of question that will have multiple choice options below for the user to try and guess the correct answer. 
- At the end of each quiz, there will be a score of the ones that were answered correctly and also incorrectly.

#### Build Features Checklist Through The Project:
##### Core Functionality
- Create an array of questions, pick a topic theme for these.
- Create a way to keep track of the selected answers from the user.
- Build out the HTML as detailed as I can and only import information in via javascript where necessary to avoid "Div Soup."
- Do smooth transitions from one question to the next, such as a fade in and out when the question changes. 
- Add in buttons for "Next" that will take you to the next question.
- Eventually have the end page display the questions answered correctly and a separate section of the question that were answered incorrectly for the user to review.

##### Nice To Haves:
- Have the color of the button selects change when selected, more of UI flavor.
- Display a percentage correct based off of the numbers of questions answered correctly/incorrectly.
- Have a "Back" button that will take the user back one page with the selected answer highlighted.
